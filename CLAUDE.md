# evalup

This repo builds **evalup** — a Claude Code plugin that evaluates and improves
any LLM chat/agent application: discover the app's architecture, generate eval
datasets, run layered scoring, analyze failures, optimize prompts with
statistical keep/revert gates.

Kept short on purpose: this file loads into every session. Depth goes in the
documents named below, not here.

## Layout

- **`evalup/`** — the plugin (v0.1.0). 7 skills (`start`, `discover`,
  `generate`, `run`, `analyze`, `optimize`, `help`), 3 agents, 17 CLI scripts
  in `scripts/`, specs in `docs/`, the worked example in `examples/quickstart/`.
- **`EVAL-DESIGN-RECOMMENDATION.md`** + **`research/`** — why the plugin works
  the way it does. Authoritative for *direction*, not for current state.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — a specification. There is no remote, so **it
  has never run. Never report CI as green.**

## Working on the plugin

**Read `evalup/CONTRIBUTING.md` before changing anything under `evalup/`.** It
has the three blessed checks and the rules that look arbitrary until you break
one. The short version:

```sh
cd evalup
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests                    # 706 tests, ~2min
ruff check --config ruff.toml .                          # --config is required
uv run --python 3.9 --with pytest --with pytest-subtests python -m pytest tests -q
```

## State

- On **`main`**, which is current: the remediation wave, the worked example,
  the rename and the doc cleanup are all merged. Nothing is pushed; **there is
  still no remote**, so nothing here has ever been checked by CI.
- **Health:** 706 tests pass on 3.13, 705 + 1 skip + 78 subtests on the 3.9
  floor, ruff clean, 17 CLIs answer `--help`. Verified 2026-09-20.
- **Renamed `agent-eval` → `evalup` on 2026-09-14** (committed 2026-09-20).
  Trademarks, domains and plugin marketplaces were **not** checked — do that
  before publishing anything.
- **History was rewritten 2026-09-20** to carry a personal author email rather
  than a work one. Every SHA therefore changed; SHAs quoted in commit messages
  written before that date refer to the pre-rewrite history and will not
  resolve.

## Scope — decided, not forgotten

- **The remediation wave is CLOSED** (2026-09-10) and the worked example
  shipped. Nothing from it is open.
- **Do NOT rewrite the scorers.** They audited clean — statistics verified,
  HTML escaping hardened, multiset trajectory semantics, regex watchdog, authz
  honest-degradation. Hold that line.
- **Out of plan by decision:** RAG/retrieval scoring, and the five "ideas worth
  stealing" from the 2026-08 review. Those are a greenfield wave, not
  remediation. Five reserved case fields wait for a scorer that reads them —
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` names them; do not wire one up without one.

## History lives in git, not at the repo root

The audit, the review, the build plan and the session handoff were deleted
2026-09-20 once their work was closed — as was `field-test-qa/`, a 2026-07-18
QA archive (`git show de9641a` has it). Code comments refer to "the 2026-09
audit" or "the 2026-08 review"; those are the commit history, not files. Don't
recreate them as files. When a doc's job ends, delete it and let the commit
messages carry the reasoning.
